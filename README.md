## Ketogenic recipes and useful information

These pages are a work in progress. They were originally started to keep track
of recipes that me and my wife use for our Daughter who is on the ketogenic
diet.

In some cases, the recipes are tweaked from original recipes found elsewhere
to take advantage of ingredients that are more readily available or are more
to our Daughter's palate.
